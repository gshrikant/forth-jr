Forth Jr - A naive FORTH implementation
========================================

This is a work in progress! At this point it is barely even a decent
RPN calculator that resembles FORTH notation. The actual interpreter
doesn't quite interpret yet - which is to say it is not possible to
write your own function definitions.

This said, I've attempted to reduce dynamic memory allocation in the
code (except bits here and there) in order to eventually run this on
a microcontroller (as all FORTHs are destined to do).
